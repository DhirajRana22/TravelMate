                        <p>When you make a booking through TravelMate, you are entering into a contract with the Bus Operator, not with TravelMate. We act as an intermediary, facilitating the booking process and providing customer support.</p>
                        <p>By making a booking, you agree to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide accurate passenger information</li>

                            <li>Arrive at the boarding point at least 15 minutes before the scheduled departure time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>E-tickets issued by TravelMate are valid only when presented with a valid ID that matches the passenger information provided during booking. The Bus Operator reserves the right to deny boarding if the passenger fails to present a valid ID or if the ID does not match the passenger information.</p>
                        <p>TravelMate is not responsible for any changes to the bus schedule, route, or amenities made by the Bus Operator. In case of any such changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and assist you in making alternative arrangements.</p>

                        <h3>5. Payment & Refunds</h3>
                        <p>All payments made through TravelMate are processed securely. We accept various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, net banking, eSewa, Khalti, IME Pay, FonePay, and mobile banking.</p>

                        <p>The total fare displayed during the booking process includes the bus fare, taxes, and TravelMate's service fee. The service fee is non-refundable in most cases.</p>
                        <p>Refunds for cancelled bookings are processed according to the cancellation policy (see Section 6). Refunds are generally processed to the original payment method, and the time it takes for the refund to reflect in your account depends on your payment provider.</p>

                        <p>General cancellation policy:</p>
                        <ul>
